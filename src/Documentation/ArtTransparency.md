# 1. Purpose of the project

I would like to create a website to present a data visualisation of the Google Spreadsheet, titled ‘Art/Museum Salary Transparency 2019’, a shared document in which respondents are listing details including the name of their organization, their role, start and end salary and employee benefits.

In addition to the data visualisation I would like to add a survey where the users can insert data on their past professional experiences in the art field. The collected data will be stocked in a database. 

# 2. Structure of the project

I would like to integrate the following template (http://www.mashup-template.com/preview.html?template=univers).

The website has four sections:
- Home 
- About the project
- Data visualisation
- Survey 

# 3. Technical aspects 

The Google  Spreadsheet data was cleaned with OpenRefine. I would like to use a data visualisation library Canvasjs.
